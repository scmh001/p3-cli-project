## Description
Blackjack CLI is a command-line interface application that brings the excitement of the classic casino card game Blackjack to your terminal. Test your luck and skills by playing against the computer dealer in this interactive and entertaining game.

## Usage
To start type above command; enter player name; begin.
>python blackjack.py --play

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your player name and play the game. You can choose to **hit** or **stand** on your turn. The game will display the outcome (win, loss, or tie) after each round.
To view past game outcomes, enter **'view'** at the main menu. To quit the game, enter **'quit'**.


## Technologies / Libraries Include:
1. Python
2. Rich library (for enhanced CLI formatting)
3. Prompt Toolkit (for interactive prompts)
4. Click (for command-line interface creation)
5. SQLAlchemy (for database management)
6. Argparse (help and usage messages)

players: Stores player ID and name
game_sessions: Stores game outcomes with player ID, dealer and player hand values, and outcome (win/loss/tie)
