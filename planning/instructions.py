-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            
Blackjack is a game played against a dealer. The goal is to have a hand that sums to a 
higher hand than the dealer without going over 21. The player must place a bet prior to the deal.  
The initial deal of the hand is two cards for each the player/s and dealer. The player's cards 
will both be faced up, the dealer will have one card faced up, and one card face down. The player 
will decide if another card is wanted (Hit) based on what the dealers faced up card is 
showing, or whether they want to play the dealer with just those two cards (Stand).  The hit option
is available 3 time for a max total of 5 player cards.  If at anypoint the player exceeds 21 the 
player automatically loses and the dealer takes the bet.  If the player stands before going over 21 
the game proceeds to the dealers draw cycle.  The dealer has hard rules, they must draw with a value
of 16 or below, and must stand on anything higher than 16.  
    
Card values:  Numbered cards are worth their number value, face cards are all worth 10, and Aces are 
worth 1 or 11, players choice.
